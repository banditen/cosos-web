## üéØ Core Mission

**COSOS is the proactive AI decision-maker for solopreneurs and early-stage CEOs that transforms business execution from reactive chaos into strategic clarity.**

We don't just assist‚Äîwe **command**. We don't just brief‚Äîwe **decide**. We don't wait for you to ask‚Äîwe **act**.

---

## ÔøΩ Security & Privacy: Non-Negotiable

**Your data is yours. Your AI is yours. Period.**

COSOS is built on a foundation of **zero-trust security** and **absolute privacy**:

### **Core Security Principles:**

1. **Private by Design**
   - Your AI agent learns ONLY from your data
   - No cross-user training or data sharing
   - Each user's intelligence is isolated and private
   - Your business context never leaves your account

2. **Enterprise-Grade Encryption**
   - All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - All data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive fields
   - Zero-knowledge architecture where possible

3. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Database-level access controls via Supabase RLS
   - Users can ONLY access their own data
   - No admin backdoors or data access
   - Enforced at the database layer, not just application

4. **OAuth 2.0 Best Practices**
   - Industry-standard authentication
   - Minimal scope requests (only what's needed)
   - Token rotation and expiration
   - Secure token storage (encrypted in database)

5. **No Data Sharing or Training**
   - We NEVER train AI models on your data
   - We NEVER share data with third parties
   - We NEVER sell or monetize your data
   - OpenAI API calls use zero-retention mode

6. **Compliance Roadmap**
   - ‚úÖ GDPR-ready (data deletion, export, privacy controls)
   - ‚úÖ CCPA-ready (California privacy compliance)
   - üéØ SOC 2 Type II (Q3 2026)
   - üéØ ISO 27001 (Q4 2026)
   - üéØ HIPAA-ready (2027, if needed)

7. **Transparency & Control**
   - Full audit logs of AI actions
   - Granular permission controls
   - One-click data export
   - One-click data deletion
   - Clear privacy policy (no legal jargon)

### **Why This Matters:**

**Cofounder:** Not clear on data privacy or cross-user training
**Ambient:** SOC 2 compliant, but shared AI learning model
**COSOS:** Private AI that learns ONLY from your data, with enterprise security from day 1

**You're trusting us with your most sensitive business data:**
- Strategic plans and goals
- Customer emails and conversations
- Financial metrics and runway
- Competitive intelligence
- Personal calendar and priorities

**We take that responsibility seriously.** No shortcuts. No compromises. No leaks.

### **Security Commitment:**

- üîí **Private AI** - Your agent is trained only on your data
- üîí **Zero Data Sharing** - Never shared, sold, or used for training
- üîí **Enterprise Security** - Bank-level encryption and access controls
- üîí **Full Transparency** - Audit logs and clear privacy policy
- üîí **Your Control** - Export or delete your data anytime

**This is not a feature. This is our foundation.**
